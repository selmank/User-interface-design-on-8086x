# User-interface-design-on-8086x
menu design 
I designed an user interface with 6 different sections.
You can scroll around each section using the left or right button on the keyboard. 
Each time when you are on a menu ,its colours are getting reversed .
You have to press the enter button to select.
Also you can press esc to quit the program.
